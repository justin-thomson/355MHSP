We are doing a Mental Health Support App for students. Many university students face a high level of stress and anxiety and it can be tough for them to afford tools for self-care. Our goal is to create an app that provides students with everyday mental health resources. This will include mood tracking which will securely store and show visuals of trends over time. As well, it will have a resource library of curated coping strategies, articles, papers, and hotline information for immediate help. With that will include personalized wellness tips which will be tailored to the user's mood entries.
